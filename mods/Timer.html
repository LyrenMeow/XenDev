<h5 id="TextSize1"> Timer </h5>
<p>It is essential to have <b>loading times removed</b> from the mod you are playing:</p>
<p id="TextSize2">1. Right-click LiveSplit and press Edit Splits
<p id="TextSize2">2. Change the game name to <b>Half-Life 2 Mods</b> (Some mods work with their own respective name)
<p id="TextSize2">3. SourceSplit options should appear above the splits. Press Activate
<p id="TextSize2">4. Press Settings. In the Settings, see that the Game Time is set to Engine Ticks with Pauses
<p id="TextSize2">5. Press Ok in the SourceSplit window and Splits Editor
<p id="TextSize2">6. Right-click LiveSplit, hover over Compare Against and select Game Time. If the Game Time doesn’t work, it’s because of your Layout Settings. In your layout, you have to compare against either “Current timing method” or Game time.
<p id="TextSize2">7. Save your layout, save your splits. This way you don’t have to setup everything for the second time, only some of the steps when you are going to run another mod. It is recommended toduplicate splits from another HL2 mod to a new one so it’s easy to skip steps 2-5.
<p id="TextSize2">8. When you relaunch your LiveSplit, do it from the LiveSplit’s executable, not through the splits/layout file. This way it saves all the settings, such as which splits you had last time, which layout you used and it saves the setting for step 6.

<p>Some mods have an automatic timer that works only with 2838's version of the SourceSplit, you can get it from here:</p>
<p style="color:#8888ff"><a href="https://github.com/thisis2838/SourceSplit/releases">https://github.com/thisis2838/SourceSplit/releases</a></p>
<p> Replace your <b>LiveSplit.SourceSplit.dll</b> with the one from the link above in your LiveSplit's <b>/Components</b> folder.</p>
